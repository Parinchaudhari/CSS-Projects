                    <h2 class="titles">What is a Sport</h2>
                    <p>Sport pertains to any form of competitive physical activity or game that aims to use, maintain, or
                        improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants and, in some cases,
                        entertainment to spectators.Sports can, through casual or organized participation, improve one's
                        physical health. Hundreds of sports exist, from those between single contestants, through to those with
                        hundreds of simultaneous participants, either in teams or competing as individuals. In certain sports
                        such as racing, many contestants may compete, simultaneously or consecutively, with one winner; in
                        others, the contest (a match) is between two sides, each attempting to exceed the other. Some sports
                        allow a "tie" or "draw", in which there is no single winner; others provide tie-breaking methods to
                        ensure one winner and one loser. A number of contests may be arranged in a tournament producing a
                        champion. Many sports leagues make an annual champion by arranging games in a regular sports season,
                        followed in some cases by playoffs. <span><b>Did you know: According to the World Sports Encyclopaedia
                        (2003), there are 8,000 indigenous sports and sporting games.</b></span></p>
                    <p>Sport is usually governed by a set of rules or customs, which serve to ensure fair competition, and allow
                        consistent adjudication of the winner. Winning can be determined by physical events such as scoring
                        goals or crossing a line first. It can also be determined by judges who are scoring elements of the
                        sporting performance, including objective or subjective measures such as technical performance or
                        artistic impression.
                        Records of performance are often kept, and for popular sports, this information may be widely announced
                        or reported in sport news. Sport is also a major source of entertainment for non-participants, with
                        spectator sport drawing large crowds to sport venues, and reaching wider audiences through broadcasting.
                        Sport betting is in some cases severely regulated, and in some cases is central to the sport.</p>
